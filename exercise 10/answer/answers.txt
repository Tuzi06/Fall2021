1. How long did your reddit_averages.py take with 
(1) the reddit-0 data set and effectively no work,3.66s
 (2) no schema specified and not caching (on reddit-2 for this and the rest), 6.073s
(3) with a schema but not caching, 4.876s
(4) with both a schema and caching the twice-used DataFrame?4.453s
2. Based on the above, does it look like most of the time taken to process the reddit-2 data set is in reading the files, or calculating the averages?
in reading the files. because with no work it take 3.66s. it taken most time in reading the files and calculating the averages

3. Where did you use .cache() in your wikipedia_popular.py? [Hint: the answer had better be “once”… but where?]
I use cache() in result1, it is store the maximun requested groupby date
