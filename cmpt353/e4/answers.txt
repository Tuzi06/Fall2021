1.  As most of city's temperatures are in the range of 10 to 30, regardless of its population density. Also, with cities that has similar popluation density, the temperature can have a significant difference. This means that there is no correclation between two varaibles. So that, daily temperature is not a good way to predict population density. 
2.  Although we need decompressing every time before we work with data, when we are working with compressed .json file. 
    Compressed .json files are much smaller than those uncompressed one, which compressed .json may just can load the entire file into memory before do anything with it, which is much faster than processing uncompressed .json, which need to load piece by piece and process that piece  before load the next one.
