1. Where you did the same calculations with NumPy and Pandas, which did you find easier to work with? Which code do you think is easier to read?
I think pandas is easier to read. Numpy show the number in array, but panda show the data in data frame. 
pandas can better analyze the data.

2. What were the running times of the two pivot_months_* functions? How can you explain the difference?
the running time of pandas is 54.1 ms ± 8.93 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)
the running time of loops is 997 ms ± 16.2 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
If we use a loop, the function will iterate over the whole object. Python can´t take advantage of any built-in functions and it is very slow. then using the panda, it can avoid Python-level loops and there is to data storage and manipulation.
