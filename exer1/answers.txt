1.  Pandas is easier to work with and easier to read, as numpy presents in array(no labels in the ouput), Pandas presents reuslt in the DataFrame (with labels),which is more readable.
2.  Running time for pivot_months_pandas: 14.7 ms ± 377 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
    Running time for pivot_months_loops:  502 ms ± 4.81 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
    As python standard libraries are slow in processing data, and with loop ( for loop in the function), we need go through whole data list. 
    With pandas, data store in a collection of numpy array, which is faster to access, and we do not use loop to process data, instead using pandas functions, which its performance has already been optimized by the auther.
