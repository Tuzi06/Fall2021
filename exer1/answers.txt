1.  Pandas is easier to work with and easier to read, as numpy presents in array(no labels in the ouput), Pandas presents reuslt in the DataFrame (with labels),which is more readable.
2.  Running time for pivot_months_pandas: 14.7 ms ± 377 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
    Running time for pivot_months_loops:  502 ms ± 4.81 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
    As Pandas may divides those data into smaller loops and process these smaller loops concurrently, it optimize the usage of hardware, which increase the performance.
    On the other hand pivot_months_loops(data) function did all calculation in a single big loop, and standard python libraries usually did not optimize the performance, which may leads to slower in the overall result.
