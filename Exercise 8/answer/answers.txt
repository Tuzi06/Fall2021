1. Which model did the best for the colour-prediction task? Can you give a theory about why? Do you have any theory about why RGB/LAB/HSV worked better for different models?
Knn and Random forest get the similar score, but to compare Knn is best results and obtained when used K = 9. Because the assumptions in the Naïve Bayes analysis/​model is components of the input are independent, and we can look at them as normally-distributed. 


2. Have a look at the cities in your validation data where the weather model makes the wrong prediction. Do you feel like the model is making reasonable mistakes? Can you think of any weather features that we could potentially add to make better predictions?
yes, the model is making reasonable mistakes.  add average of temperature
