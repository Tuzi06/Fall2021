1.  the reddit-0 data set and effectively no work:	        0m9.900s
    no schema specified and not caching:                    0m21.594s
    with a schema but not caching:                          0m15.129s
    with both a schema and caching the twice-used DataFrame:0m13.526s

2.  The most of time is taken in reading files, if we use only schema or  both schema and caching. If we do not use neither schema nor caching, then the most of time is taken in calculation.

3.  I used before groupby(). as data will not be changed any more.
