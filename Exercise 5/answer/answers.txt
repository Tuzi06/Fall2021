1. Which of the four transforms suggested got you the closest to satisfying the assumptions of a T-test?  square root 




2. I gave imprecise English translations of what the by-week test, and the Mann-Whitney test were actually testing. Do the same for the original T-test, and for the transformed data T-test. That is, describe what the conclusion would be if you could reject the null hypothesis in those tests.

p-value<0.5, reject the H0, so the data is not normal distribution

3. Of the four approaches, which do you think actually does a better job of getting an answer for the original question: “are there a different number of Reddit comments posted on weekdays than on weekends?” Briefly explain why. (It's not clear to me that there is a single correct answer to this question.)
square root data better.



4. When are more Reddit comments posted in /r/canada, on average weekdays or weekends?
From the data, mean of comments for weekdays is more than weekend, but weekdays have more data. So it is can not orve which one have more comments.
